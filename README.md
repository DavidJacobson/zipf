###Zipf's Law Verifcation For Python

An attempt at verifying if [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) holds for programming languages also

We tried to verify that for python. The "library" for our "language" is the [flask project] (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask)

The entire Flask project has 885 python files and close to 11200 python keywords. We tried to test if these keywords also follow zipf's law
